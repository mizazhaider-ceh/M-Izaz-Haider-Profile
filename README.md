# 🚀 My Journey & Motivation

## 💡 How a Small Thought Led Me to Cybersecurity

It all started with a simple question: **"What is software engineering?"** 🤔💻

When I was in **7th grade** 📚, I first heard this term, and it sparked my curiosity.
Who are software engineers? What do they do? 🤷‍♂️ My quest for answers led me to explore different fields of technology.

Then, in **8th grade** 🎯, I came across the term **ethical hacking**. At first, I believed that all hackers were bad. ❌💀I had questions like:

- 🤔 **Why do hackers attack systems?**
- 🛠️ **How do they do it?**
- 🎭 **What do they gain from it?**
- 🛡️ **Can they be stopped?**

As I dug deeper, I discovered that while **black hat hackers** 🏴‍☠️ cause harm, **white hat hackers** 👨‍💻 use their skills to protect systems.
This realization fascinated me, but I was still unaware that **cybersecurity would become my passion**.

## 💻 The Defining Moment: When My Account Got Hacked

Everything changed when one of my **Gmail accounts was hacked**. 🆘📩
This account was linked to my gaming ID 🎮, and losing access frustrated me. 😡

But instead of just feeling angry, I started asking myself:

- 🔑 **How did the hacker gain access?**
- ⚠️ **What mistakes did I make?**
- 🔒 **How can I prevent this from happening again?**

As I explored further, I realized that **millions of people fall victim to cyberattacks every day**. 🌍💥
That’s when I made a decision:

- 👉 **I will not only protect myself but also help secure others from hackers.** 🛡️🔍

That small thought—wondering how hacking works—grew into a deep **passion for cybersecurity**. ❤️‍🔥💻
It became clear that **my path was set, and there was no turning back.** 🚀

## 🚧 Challenges I Overcame While Learning Cybersecurity
